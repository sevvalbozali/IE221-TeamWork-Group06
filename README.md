# IE221 TeamWork 3 – Group 06

## Project Description
This project experimentally verifies the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using simulation methods. In addition, the Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate the value of π, demonstrating a practical application of SLLN.
